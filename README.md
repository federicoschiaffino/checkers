# Checkers 

Checker (or Draughts) is a two players board game played worldwide. Usually played on the same board as chess, the objective of each player is to capture, i.e. eat, each opponent's piece. Initially, each player has 12 pawns that can only move forward and diagonally - the game is played only on one colour of the board, typically on the black squares - and can eat by jumping over the opponent's piece. Once a pawn reaches the last row of the board this is promoted into a Queen (or King), a more powerful that piece that can also move backwards.
